# Machine Learning and AI in Pacman
The Pacman Project.
Applying all sorts of different machine learning and AI algorithms to the game of Pacman, enabled Pacman to intelligently navigate the game environment, optimizing objectives like shortest path to food, ghost avoidance, and maximizing outcomes.

Designed and engineered custom data structures such as heuristics, cost function, probability table, and Monte Carlo tree to assist algorithm performance. It requires applying an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, the projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, it focuses on foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

The projects allowed me to immediately visualize the results of my own algorithms, and respond accordingly. They contain code examples and directions but do not force students to wade through undue amounts of scaffolding. Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too.

# The scope of the project:

Search
Depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms are used, as well as designing evaluation functions.


Reinforcement Learning
Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.


Ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.


Classification
Standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
